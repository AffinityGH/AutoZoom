# AutoZoom
A program designed to make your Zoom schedule easier to follow.

Feel free to distribute the code, but please do not claim it as your own. Please ask before using portions of my code as well.

**Important Program Settings**

Make sure you run the program as administrator when you need to make a new schedule!

A PERMANENT FIX TO THIS ISSUE (until next release):
1. Open the directory to which AutoZoom was installed to.
2. Right click autozoom.exe
3. Select "Properties"
4. Go to the "Compatibility" tab.
5. Select "Run this program as an administrator"
6. Press "Apply"

This should fix all the issue regarding a new file not being created when you go to new schedule.

**Important Zoom Settings**

Go to Zoom Settings in the Zoom desktop application.
Video >> Turn off my video when joining meeting.
Audio >> Automatically join audio by computer when joining a meeting.
Audio >> Mute my microphone when joining a meeting.

**Important Chrome Settings**

Make sure when a Zoom link opens, it automatically opens the Zoom application. (Click Always when you are prompted by the dialogue)

**TL;DR Installation Guide** 

Simply download and run the installer to install AutoZoom.
Once the install is finished, simply run AutoZoom.

**Update Existing Installation** 

BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING:
  To save your existing schedules, extract the text files out of the existing installation directory and save them to a folder.
  
1. Uninstall the old version of AutoZoom.
2. Run the new AutoZoom installer and wait for the installation to complete.
3. To reupload your schedules, simply add them to the new installation folder in the same spot where you found them.

**Please submit all bug reports to the GitHub so I can address them!**
